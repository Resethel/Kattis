Kattis-Solutions
=======

This repository is a collection of all the solutions I found while trying to tackle
some of Kattis problems.

I do not guarantee any of those solutions while work for you (there might be some unfinished problems I uploaded by mistakes without writing any informations about their completion status).
nor I guarantee that they are the fastest or most efficient solution logically-wise or
programmatically wise.

Also note that this repository code is under the [Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
So do what the f*** you want with this code !
